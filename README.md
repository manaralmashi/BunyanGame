* ### Idea of the project:
The idea of the game is different because it contains three stages. Each stage represents a floor of
the house that the player wants to build. In each stage there is a different game that the player
must complete in order to collect points that will help him build a floor of the house. It is worth
noting that there are points and time to increase the effectiveness of the game and the possibility
of accurate arrangement of players' positions.
